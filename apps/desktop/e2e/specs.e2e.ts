/**
 * A Spec written beside the chat of a `define` Session (designs D7-01, D7-03, D7-07, D7-09,
 * D7-11, D7-12, D7-14).
 *
 * One journey, in the order a hand makes it, on one data folder: a `free` Session whose agent
 * proposes a Spec through `spec_propose`, the proposal accepted, the brief handed over before the
 * next turn, a human edit handed over as it is saved, a question asked and answered in the chat, a
 * conflict applied, and a second Session that reads the draft and takes it over. The restart is
 * `specs.reopened.e2e.ts`, which starts a second instance on the folder this one wrote
 * (`wdio.conf.ts`, `CONTINUED`), finds the draft, its phases and the text left in a buffer, and
 * takes the Spec to `ready`.
 *
 * Two acts are not a hand's, and say so where they are made:
 *
 * - Some of the agent's writes. The fake agent follows a script fixed when its turn starts, so it
 *   cannot write on a version it reads during the turn: what it would write under the human's
 *   open editor, and the question, go through the window's own bridge, as the human actor the
 *   renderer always is, which moves the section's version all the same. What it writes on its
 *   own, through `spec_write`, is `specs.reopened.e2e.ts`'s.
 * - The second Session. Nothing in the window lists Specs yet: it is opened on the Spec through
 *   `specs.openSession`, the call such a list would make.
 *
 * Each suite is named after the scenario it covers.
