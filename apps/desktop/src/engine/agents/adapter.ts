/**
 * What an agent is, from Hemera's side (design D5-02, D5-21).
 *
 * Three agents are supported — Claude Code, Codex and OpenCode — and each of them is described
 * by one file under `adapters/`: the command a reader installs and signs into, the sentence
 * that says how to get it, the command that signs it in, where it keeps that login, how to read
 * its version out of what it prints, and what its own answer to `initialize` says about being
 * signed in. This file holds the shape those three agree on, so that a fourth agent becomes a
 * compile error everywhere it has to be mentioned rather than a place someone forgets.
 *
 * The list of them is the domain's and not this file's (`AGENT_PROVIDERS` in `@hemera/core`):
 * a check on `sessions.provider` admits exactly it, so an agent added here alone would be a
 * value the database has never heard of, which is a migration.
 *
 * The agent is the subject of every field below, and the adapter that may expose it is not. Two
 * of the three speak no ACP themselves, and what exposes them is a package of Hemera's — named
 * in `acp`, spawned by the supervisor, never shown and never asked of the reader (D5-21). The
 * Agents page speaks of Claude Code, Codex and OpenCode, and of nothing else.
 *
 * The agent itself is never embedded: it is the command the reader installed and signed in, and
 * it is looked for on the `PATH` they already have (issue decision 93). The **adapter** is the
 * opposite — it is a dependency of this application, resolved out of Hemera's own
 * `node_modules`, because asking a reader to install `claude-agent-acp` is asking them to
 * install Hemera's plumbing (D5-21). An agent that is not installed is not installed, and no
 * other one takes its place (D5-17).
