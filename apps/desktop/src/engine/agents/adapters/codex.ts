/**
 * Codex, and the adapter that exposes it (design D5-02, D5-21).
 *
 * The agent is `codex`: the command OpenAI's own documentation tells a reader to install and to
 * sign in with, and the only command the Agents page ever names. Codex speaks no ACP itself, and
 * what exposes it is `@agentclientprotocol/codex-acp` — a dependency of this application,
 * carried with it, forked by the supervisor, never installed, never shown and never asked of the
 * reader (`docs/technical/acp-providers-2026-09.md` §3, D5-21).
 *
 * As with Claude Code, the adapter left to itself would run the Codex carried in its own
 * `@openai/codex` dependency, and Hemera ships none of it: `CODEX_PATH` is what the adapter
 * reads to know which `codex` to start `app-server` on, so a Session runs the one this machine
 * has (`dist/index.js`, `startCodexConnection`). The login is what makes it usable.
 *
 * Where that login lives is the agent's own choice: `auth.json` inside the directory `CODEX_HOME`
 * names, `~/.codex` when it is not set. A machine that keeps its credentials in a keyring
 * instead (`cli_auth_credentials_store = keyring`) writes no file, so it reads as signed out
 * here — the word that counts is the one the agent gives at `initialize`, and this is only what
 * can be said before a Session starts.
 *
 * Signing in stays outside Hemera: the sign-in is `codex login`, which opens a browser, and
 * Hemera types it for nobody. Of the methods Codex publishes, the API key is the one it offers
 * whatever the machine's state is — it reads the key from the environment or from the request —
 * so its presence says nothing about being signed in, and a list that holds nothing else is read
 * as an agent with nothing left to do. The ChatGPT flows are the sign-in: one opens a browser,
 * the other is offered only to a client that supports URL elicitation, and Hemera drives
 * neither, so a list holding one is a Session that stops with a note rather than a route taken
 * on the user's behalf (D5-17).
