/**
 * What makes an agent run bare: its own tools gone, Hemera's the only ones left (design D6-02,
 * D6-09).
 *
 * There is no native mode and no toggle. Every Session is bare, or it is not opened at all, and
 * the means belongs to each agent: Claude Code reads its options out of `session/new`'s `_meta`,
 * Codex reads them there and from its environment through Hemera's patch of its adapter, and
 * OpenCode takes them from the environment and a directory of Hemera's own. What each adapter
 * declares is that means, and the answer to the only question that matters here — whether the
 * means removes *every* tool the agent ships. An agent that answers no is refused, with the
 * residue it keeps as the reason.
 *
 * The declarations come from the spike `docs/technical/bare-mode-2026-09.md` (21 September 2026),
 * which read them in the three agents' own sources. Until the phase 3 trial per agent and
 * platform, what is written here is what those sources say, not what a run has shown.
 *
 * The platform is a parameter and not `process.platform`: the answer is declared per platform
 * (D6-02), and the one place where the two differ today — OpenCode's wildcard matching is
 * case-insensitive on Windows only — has to be checkable from a machine that is neither.
