/**
 * The agents this machine has, and which of them can be used (D5-02, D5-21).
 *
 * Everything else about an agent is a description; this is where the machine answers. Discovery
 * looks each agent's own command up on the `PATH` the user already has — `npx` never, a download
 * never (issue decision 93) — reads the version the command prints, looks for the login file the
 * agent's own command writes, and reports the three agents in the order Hemera knows them, found
 * or missing, each with what to install it and what signs it in.
 *
 * It picks nothing. An agent that is missing is reported missing, and the other two are not
 * offered in its place (D5-17). It never starts anything, and it never opens the file it looks
 * for: being signed in is the one bit of it this page shows, and the file belongs to the reader
 * (D5-21). What the word really is, the agent says when a Session asks it to `initialize`; this
 * is what can be said before one starts.
 *
 * What it never looks for on the `PATH` is an adapter. Two of the three agents speak no ACP, and
 * the packages that expose them are dependencies of this application: `resolve` takes their entry
 * module out of what the installation carries and hands it to the supervisor to be forked as a
 * Node script, so nothing about them is ever installed by, shown to, or asked of the reader
 * (D5-21). Which agent such an adapter then runs is named to it in its own environment, because
 * an adapter left to itself would run a platform binary of its own that Hemera does not ship.
 * And it refuses before it resolves: an agent this machine does not have and an agent
 * nobody signed in are both answered as themselves, rather than by a process started to find out.

 * last answer that is still an answer, because npm's own prefix is a `node_modules` and a
