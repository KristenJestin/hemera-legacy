/**
 * The fake agent, and the process it pretends to be (design D5-16).
 *
 * The engine's tests need an agent to talk to, and the point of them is the protocol rather than
 * a mock's opinion of it: so this is a real peer, built with the SDK's agent side, connected to
 * the client by a pair of in-memory streams. What it answers is scripted, and everything else —
 * the framing, the request ids, the handshake, the permission request — is the protocol's own.
 *
 * It lives under `src/` rather than under `tests/` because it is more than a test's file now:
 * `fakeSupervisor` answers the `ProcessSupervisor` port, so the runtime can be built from a real
 * `start`, real lines and a real death without a child process anywhere on the machine. The lint
 * refuses `vi.mock`, and injection through a port is the way (D5-16).
 *
 * Nothing here is started, installed or reached by the application: the engine imports the port,
 * never this file, and what the fake proves is that Hemera's side of a conversation is what the
 * protocol says it should be — the half of phase 1 that can be proved with no agent installed.
