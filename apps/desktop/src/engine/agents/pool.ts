/**
 * The agents that are running, and when one of them is let go (design D5-05).
 *
 * An agent is a process, and a process nobody is talking to is a process paying rent: this file
 * keeps the small book of what is live and answers which ones have been idle long enough to be
 * let go of. It holds no agent of its own — the runtime owns the connections, because it is the
 * runtime that routes what an agent says — and it holds the *release* the runtime gave it, which
 * is what its sweep pulls the trigger on.
 *
 * Two rules are the whole of it, and both are the design's: an agent is let go when it has been
 * idle long enough, and never while a turn is running or a question is waiting for an answer.
 * What makes that testable is the clock: the time is a port rather than `Date.now()`, so a suite
 * advances five minutes in a millisecond and reads what the sweep did, rather than waiting.
