/**
 * One turn, from the prompt to its stop reason (design D5-05, D5-09, D5-12).
 *
 * The runtime is what stands between the window and an agent. It finds the agent, starts it,
 * opens the native session, writes every entry the thread keeps, asks the user when the agent
 * needs a decision, and closes the turn however it ends: a stop reason, a Stop, or a death.
 *
 * Everything it writes goes through `Sessions`, so the thread is the same whether it is read
 * while the turn runs or after the window was closed — and everything it writes is also handed
 * to `AgentNotices`, so a window watching that Session sees it as it happens rather than by
 * asking again.
 *
 * Nothing here is a step of its own: the runtime holds the connection of each Session, the turn
 * each of them is running, and it is the only writer of the entries an agent produced. A
 * permission is a `Deferred` the agent's own question blocks on, which is what makes Stop able
 * to answer a question nobody answered.
