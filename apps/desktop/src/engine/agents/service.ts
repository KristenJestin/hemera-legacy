/**
 * The three agents, as this machine and their registries answer for them (design D5-18).
 *
 * This is what the Agents section of the settings is drawn from, and it is two different
 * questions rather than one. `list` is local and answers in milliseconds: which commands the
 * machine has, what version each prints, and the tool that put it there. `check` is the same
 * answer with one more field filled in, and it is the only thing in this file that leaves the
 * machine — it reads what was published for every agent that is found, whatever installed it,
 * which is why it is asked for when the section is opened and never on a schedule, and why a
 * registry that says nothing leaves a version unknown rather than making the section fail.
 *
 * `update` is the one thing here that changes the machine, and it happens only because somebody
 * pressed a button. It runs the tool that installed the agent — never a command of Hemera's own,
 * never a download into a directory Hemera owns — and answers with what that tool printed. What
 * it cannot place it refuses, in a sentence that says so, rather than trying an update that
 * would fail for a reason the reader could not act on.
