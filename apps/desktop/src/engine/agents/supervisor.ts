/**
 * The processes Hemera starts, and how it makes sure none of them outlives it (design D5-04).
 *
 * An agent is a program that runs on the user's machine and, being a program, it starts others:
 * a shell, a compiler, a dev server, a formatter. Stopping the one Hemera knows about and
 * leaving the rest behind would be a Stop button that lies. So this service supervises by tree
 * and never by name — it never goes looking for a process called `claude` and kills whatever
 * wears that name, because that reaches processes that are not ours. It has one duty: nothing
 * outlives the engine.
 *
 * Every child is started in a process group of its own, and every signal goes to that group and
 * not to a lone pid, so a grandchild dies with the child that made it. Windows has no process
 * group to signal: there, a graceful stop closes the child's standard input, gives it the grace
 * to make up its mind, and only then takes the tree down by its root pid.
 *
 * The child is registered with the scope it was started in, which is what makes this hold
 * without anyone remembering to: the engine's scope is the one scope, and when it closes — on a
 * quit, on a crash, on a restart — the finalizer below stops every child it ever started.
 *
 * Two things can be started and one policy covers both: an agent's own command, spawned here,
 * and a bundled adapter, which is a Node script and cannot be — the fuse that would make Electron
 * a Node interpreter is off, so the main process forks it as a utility process and hands back a
 * pid and a port (`adapter-process.ts`, D5-21). Everything below that seam is the same.
 *
 * What the child writes on standard error is not swallowed. A program that fails says so
 * there, and a run of lines nobody read is a failure nobody can account for; so those lines are
 * handed to a sink, which the engine points at the diagnostic log. Nothing in here prints.
