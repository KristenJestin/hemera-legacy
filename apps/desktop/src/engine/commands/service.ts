/**
 * The commands of a Project, and the processes they become (design D6-11, D6-12).
 *
 * One service answers both callers — the agent through `commands_run` and the user through the
 * Project's settings — because a command is one thing with one catalogue and one set of runs. A
 * run is started by the Session that asked for it, and the Commands panel of a Session shows what
 * that Session started; but a run is the Project's to share (D6-12): any Session of the Project
 * joins a running app, reads a run's output and stops it.
 *
 * Three rules live here rather than in the tool that asks:
 *
 * - a `serve` command that is already running is handed back, never started twice, which is what
 *   `joinsRunningRun` decides and what makes a second `run` harmless;
 * - the output is kept bounded, because a process that prints for an hour must not become an
 *   hour of rows, and what was dropped is said rather than hidden;
 * - nothing outlives the engine: every process is started in the engine's own scope, so a quit
 *   takes every tree down whether or not anyone called `stop` (D5-04).
 *
 * The output is read as it arrives and never awaited: `run` answers with what there is when it
 * is asked, which is what lets a dev server that never exits still be usable. The row of a run
 * is written when it starts and rewritten when it ends, so a panel reopened after a restart
 * reads what was run and how it ended — and the Session's thread gets that same run as one
 * entry that changes state, because a run shows in the panel and in the thread (D6-12).
