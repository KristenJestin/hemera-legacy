/**
 * What an agent is provided, and how a change of it reaches it (D6-07, D6-08).
 *
 * The base is `CONTEXT_BASE`, the four sentences every Session is given once, by whatever means
 * its adapter has. The Project's instructions are the `AGENTS.md` at the root of the Workspace.
 * Whether the agent reads it itself is its adapter's declaration, since bare mode can keep it
 * from reading it. An agent that reads it is not sent it — that would be a second injection of a
 * text it already has — and the Context view says the file was read natively. An agent that does
 * not is given it at the start of the Session, and the view says so. Either way the fingerprint
 * of what was there at the start is recorded, and a later change goes the same way to both.
 *
 * A change during a Session is not a prompt either. It waits, and is handed over between two
 * turns as its own text carrying the marker that says who wrote it. What decides whether there is
 * a change is the last text the agent was given: a file edited and then put back is a change
 * each time, and a file that reads as it was last given is none.
 *
 * Nothing here watches the filesystem. The safe point is the caller's, and `pending` reads the
 * file then, which is the only moment the answer is worth anything. The entry a delivery makes
 * in the thread is the caller's too: it is written when the text is handed over, by the one that
 * hands it over, and not by the service that computed it. So is the moment a change counts as
 * given: `delivered` is told once the agent took it, and a change whose sending failed is still
 * pending at the next safe point.
