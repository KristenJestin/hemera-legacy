/**
 * What happens to a profile before anything is allowed to read it (design D3-05).
 *
 * Three cases, and only three. The profile carries the same migrations the application does,
 * and it opens. It carries fewer, and it is backed up, migrated, then opened. It carries one
 * the application has never heard of — a profile written by a newer version — and it is
 * refused, untouched, naming the version that wrote it.
 *
 * The migrations the application carries are the folders it ships in `drizzle/`; the ones the
 * profile has are the rows the migrator keeps in `__drizzle_migrations`. Neither list is
 * written by hand and neither is duplicated: the comparison is between those two.
