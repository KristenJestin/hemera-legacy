 *
 * The title is proposed from the first message and belongs to the engine, because the rule
 * that derives it is one rule: derived in the renderer, it would be two machines with two

 * the user typed is never proposed over, and nothing has to remember not to.

 * existed has none. `provider` is constrained to the agents Hemera knows how to start, so the

 * durable I — it is the handle the agent itself gave, kept so the next start can ask to resume

 * the agent was started in, kept because a resumed Session must be resumed where it ran.
