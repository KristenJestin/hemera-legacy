 * It is attached to a Project and to nothing else — no Spec, no Workspace — and `free` is the
 * absence of a mission rather than a column: this lot writes one kind of Session, and a column
 * holding one value is a column that lies about having a choice.
 *
 * The title is proposed from the first message and belongs to the engine, because the rule
 * that derives it is one rule: derived in the renderer, it would be two machines with two
 * opinions. `title_source` is what makes a proposal and a choice different things — a title
 * the user typed is never proposed over, and nothing has to remember not to.
 *
 * `last_written_at` is written by a message and by a rename both, because both are the user
 * working on the Session: the list is ordered by what was touched last, and a Session renamed
 * a minute ago is a Session the user is working on. `version` is incremented by every change
 * and compared inside the transaction, as a Project's is.
 *
 * There is no `deleted_at` and no delete: archiving is how a Session ends, and the absence of
 * the operation is the guarantee (design D4b-06).
 *
 * The agent columns (design D5-06) are nullable for the same reason `free` has no column: a
 * Session is created before it is given an agent, and every Session written before the agents
 * existed has none. `provider` is constrained to the agents Hemera knows how to start, so the
 * model it names is the model of a real one; `native_session_id` is what makes a Session
 * durable I — it is the handle the agent itself gave, kept so the next start can ask to resume
 * — and `native_state` says whether that handle is still worth anything. `cwd` is the directory
 * the agent was started in, kept because a resumed Session must be resumed where it ran.

 * own. `correlation_id` is how an update finds its row — a tool call that ends, a message that
 * finishes arriving — and `turn_id` how everything an agent did in one turn is read together.
 * `state` is where a life goes and is null for what has no life to live, a message.
