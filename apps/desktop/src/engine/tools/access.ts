/**
 * Who may ask Hemera's tools, and for how long (design D6-01, D6-03).
 *
 * A Session's tools are served by one process, on a loopback address, and the only thing that
 * says which Session a call belongs to is the token the agent process was handed at
 * `session/new`. The token is therefore the whole of the identity: it names the Session, it
 * names the agent process that received it, and it is revoked when that process ends or when
 * the Session is released.
 *
 * Two things are deliberately absent. There is no way to ask this service what a token *is* —
 * `byId` names a grant by a digest, `byToken` answers with a grant and never with the secret —
 * and a refusal is answered by the caller with a generic error, so a foreign token learns
 * nothing about which Sessions exist. And a token is never an authorisation (D6-05): what a
 * token buys is the right to ask, never the right to be obeyed, which is why nothing in this
 * file is asked when a path leaves the workspace root.
