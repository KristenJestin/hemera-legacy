 * lets a tool create a file in a folder the user asked for without first creating the folder.
 * A link that leads nowhere is not a file that does not exist yet: writing through it creates
 * whatever it points at, so it is judged by where it points, whether anything is there or not.
 *
 * Nothing here decides to refuse: it says whether a path is inside, and the caller asks the
 * human for what is not. Technical reachability is not an authorisation (D6-05), so the token a
