/**
 * Searching the workspace, bounded and resumable (design D6-04).
 *
 * A search is not a grep: it has a budget of its own — at most `SEARCH_MATCH_LIMIT` matches and
 * `SEARCH_SCAN_BYTES` bytes scanned — and it says which of the two stopped it. The cursor is
 * what makes the budget harmless: it is where the next call continues from, so an agent that
 * wants more of an answer asks for it instead of receiving a truncated one and not knowing.
 *
 * The walk is streamed: one folder is read at a time, a file is read in chunks, and the budget is
 * checked after every chunk, so a call stops where its budget ends rather than after a whole file
 * or a whole tree has been listed. A file the search passes over — one that looks binary, or one
 * it could not read — is named in the result rather than silently left out.
 *
 * `.gitignore` is respected from the workspace root, and `.git` never is: what the user told Git
 * to ignore is not what they told an agent to read. Only the root's file is read, and only its
 * simple patterns — a pattern list is a convention, not a matcher, and one that refused nothing
 * because it understood a niche syntax would be worse than one that is documented.
