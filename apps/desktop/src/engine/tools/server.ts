/**
 * The address an agent asks Hemera's tools on (design D6-01, D6-02).
 *
 * One server for the whole engine, bound to the loopback interface on a port the system picks,
 * and a token per Session inside it: what a call carries is not a port of its own but the token
 * the agent's process was handed at start. Two consequences are the point of the design. The
 * tools exist once, whether or not any Session is running — creating one is answering requests
 * and nothing else — and the port is not published anywhere: an agent gets an address and a
 * token, and the address alone gets a 401.
 *
 * The token travels as a bearer header (D6-01): the three agents take `headers` in the
 * `mcpServers` of ACP, and a header is not what a proxy logs or a crash report quotes. The query
 * of the address is read only for a grant minted to carry it there, which no agent is today, and
 * never over a header that is present. Neither is logged — what the diagnostics call a caller is
 * the digest, never the secret.
 *
 * A refused access is answered generically: the caller learns that it is not allowed, and
 * nothing about which Sessions exist or what the tools are called. The line the user may have to
 * read is written to the engine's own sink, where it belongs.
