/**
 * The three Spec tools: how a `define` Session's agent reads and writes its Spec (design D7-14).
 *
 * Everything a call is about is deduced from the Session its token was minted for, never from its
 * arguments: the Spec is the Session's, and whether it may write is the Spec's writer. The writes
 * are the engine's own use cases of `specs/`, so the tool is one more door onto the one
 * writability rule (D7-04) and not a second rule: a frozen Spec, an older revision, a stale
 * section and a Session that does not hold the write right are refused there, with the sentence
 * the agent is answered with, and nothing is written. `declarePhase` and `attest` have no other
 * door than `spec_propose` (Decided 6, 16).
