/**
 * The one way a change is written down (design D4-04).
 *
 * A mutation writes its state and the event that describes it, or it writes neither. That is not
 * a convention anybody has to remember: `mutate` takes a body that has to hand back both, so a
 * change without its provenance does not type, and the two go into the same transaction — a
 * failure anywhere inside leaves the data folder exactly as it was.
 *
 * Nothing outside the database happens in here. A folder is checked, a dialog is opened and a
 * command is run before `mutate` is called or after it has returned, never while a transaction
 * is held: a lock waiting on a human is a data folder nobody else can write to.
