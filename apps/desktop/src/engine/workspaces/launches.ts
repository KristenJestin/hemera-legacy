/**
 * Starting a build: the Spec asked for, the Workspace waited for, the Session that runs it
 * (design D8-13 of #20, and the button of D8-12 that asks for it).
 *
 * A launch is a row of its own, written before anything runs: `waiting`, on the revision the Spec
 * stood on when it was asked for and on the Workspace the user chose. Nothing else is made to
 * wait — a build Session does not wait for an environment (D8-13) — and the Journal says when it
 * was asked for.
 *
 * The Workspace becomes ready when its preparation writes its last step, and that is what starts
 * a launch waiting on it: the build Session is created on the launch's revision, in that
 * Workspace, its build begun (D10-02), and the agent
 * the Spec's writer Session runs is started in the Workspace's folder (D8-09: started is what the
 * agent's own handshake answered). A start that fails says `failed` with what the agent answered
 * and stays on screen, and `retry` starts that same Session's agent again without touching the
 * Workspace or its steps.
 *
 * The window asks for a build through `launches.request`; the preparation's last step starts what
 * waited on its Workspace.
