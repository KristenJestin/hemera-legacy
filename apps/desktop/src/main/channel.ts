 * Which build this is, and which profile it therefore opens (design D3-06).

 * being another channel. An application that is not a package is `dev`, which is the channel a
 * development run, a test and an agent all get.
 *
 * `prod` and `beta` open the same profile on purpose — the beta is the application the user
 * runs every day, on real data. `dev` opens its own, and a `dev` build may be pointed at a
 * throwaway folder instead; it may not be pointed at the real one.
 *
 * Everything here that decides is pure and takes what it reads as arguments, so the rules can
 * be checked on every platform from one machine, without Electron and without a profile.
