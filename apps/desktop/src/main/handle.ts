/**
 * The main process end of the typed bridge (design D0-04).
 *
 * Every message is read twice before anything happens: once to see where it came from, once
 * to see whether it says what its channel declares. A message that fails either is refused
 * with an error that names the channel and the field, written to the log, and dropped — the
 * handler is never reached, so a refused message has no effect to undo. The deciding is in
 * `bridge.ts`, which knows nothing of Electron and can therefore be run without one.
