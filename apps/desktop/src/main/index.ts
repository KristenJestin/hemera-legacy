 * The main process: it opens the window, wires the channels, and answers `--report`.

 * Anything that must exist before the window does is awaited at the top level of this file:
 * the module loads asynchronously, so a dynamic import would arrive after Electron is ready.
 * `ready` itself is not: Electron emits it once this module has finished evaluating, so a
 * top-level `await app.whenReady()` waits for an event its own waiting prevents.
