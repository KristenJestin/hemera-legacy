 * What the window remembers about its own shell (design D2-01, D3-08).
 *
 * Which Project is active and which entry is being looked at live here; the fold and the width
 * come from the data folder, handed to the page before it mounts and written back as they
 * change, so the sidebar never appears at a default and then jumps to what the user chose.
 *
 * A width is the exception to writing back as it changes: a drag asks for one on every pointer
 * event, and a database written to sixty times a second is a database being used as a mouse.
 * What is written is the width the hand left behind.
 *
 * The store knows nothing of what a Project is: which ones exist is the application's, and it
 * hands the identifiers in when a rank has to be resolved. That is what lets the same store
 * carry fixtures in phase 0 and the engine's own answer in phase 2.
 *
 * The same shape as the theme store beside it: a snapshot, a subscription and a few acts.
 * `useSyncExternalStore` wants a snapshot that only changes when something did, so the state
 * is replaced rather than mutated and nothing returns a fresh object for an unchanged read.
