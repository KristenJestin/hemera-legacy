/**
 * What the window remembers about its own shell, for as long as the window lasts (D2-01).
 *
 * In memory and nowhere else: which Project is active, which entry of the sidebar is being
 * looked at, whether the sidebar is folded and how wide it is. Lot 3 brings the profile, and
 * what changes then is this file — the shell is handed these four values as props either way.
 *
 * The same shape as the theme store beside it: a snapshot, a subscription and a few acts.
 * `useSyncExternalStore` wants a snapshot that only changes when something did, so the state
 * is replaced rather than mutated and nothing returns a fresh object for an unchanged read.
