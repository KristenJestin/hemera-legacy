/**
 * The three agents, as Hemera describes them to itself (design D5-02, D5-21).
 *
 * What is checked here is what each adapter claims about its own agent: the command the reader
 * installs and the `PATH` is read for, the command Hemera spawns to expose it as an ACP agent,
 * the version its output carries, where its own login file sits, and what its `initialize` answer
 * says about being signed in. The commands, the arguments and the auth methods come from the
 * survey of the three providers (`docs/technical/acp-providers-2026-09.md`), which read them in
 * the agents' own sources without running any of them.
