/**
 * One run of the application over one scripted agent, and what a suite reads it through.

 * machine's discovery answered by a layer: no binary, no model, no account, and no child process.
 *
 * Called twice on the same folder, `application()` is a second run of the application: the layers
 * are built again, the database is opened again and the agent answering is a new one. The clock is
 * the suite's, so the grace an agent is given to answer a cancel is a duration a test decides.
