/**
 * What can be done to a Session, and what is refused (design D4b-01 … D4b-06).
 *
 * Each suite is named after the scenario of the ticket's `Spec · sessions` it covers. Every one
 * of them runs on a data folder made for it under the temporary directory, migrated by the
 * migrations the application really ships, and each `opened()` call is one run of the process:
 * the layer is built again, on the same file, which is what a restart is to a database.
 *
 * Nothing here touches a folder of this machine. The thread is the user's alone — no provider,
 * no agent, no simulated answer — and that is not asserted: it is what the service is.
