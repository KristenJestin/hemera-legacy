/**
 * The Spec entries of a thread, as their blocks are drawn from them (design D7-01, D7-07, D7-09).
 *
 * `agent-blocks.tsx` draws a `mission_brief` entry as the folded Hemera line, a `spec_question`
 * as the question card — folded to its answer once the `spec_answer` entry written beside it is
 * in the thread — and a `spec_proposal` as the agent's proposal. What each block is handed is
 * read by `spec-entries.ts`, which is what is tested here: the design system is a browser's to
 * load, and its blocks are proved in Storybook.
