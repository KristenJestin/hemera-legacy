/**
 * The processes an agent starts, and how Hemera makes sure none of them outlives it (D5-04).
 *
 * Each suite is named after the scenario of the issue's `Spec · agent-runtime` section that it
 * covers. Nothing here is mocked, and nothing is `vi.mock`ed — the lint refuses it — so what is
 * driven is a real machine: real children, started with `node:child_process` through the port
 * the supervisor declares, over scripts this suite wrote into a temporary folder. That is the
 * only way to show the two things this service promises: that a process which dies is seen to
 * die, and that a grandchild does not survive its grandparent.
 *
 * What is verified is always the machine and not the call: a process is gone when the kernel
 * says so — `process.kill(pid, 0)` raising `ESRCH` — never because a `stop` returned. Nothing
 * here reaches the network, an agent, or the `PATH` of the machine running the tests.
 *
 * A child's whole life is lived inside one `opened` call, because the scope that started it is
 * what stops it: a suite that returned a child from one scope to drive it in another would be
 * testing a process its own harness had already stopped.
