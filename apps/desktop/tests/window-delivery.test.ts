/**
 * A change of the Workspace's instructions, as the window sees it arrive (design D6-08).
 *
 * The engine watches the `AGENTS.md` at the Workspace root while a Session's agent runs. What is
 * under test is the whole road, from the agent store and the tools store over the engine on the
 * fake agent: the file changes while a turn runs, nothing is handed over during that turn, and
 * once it ends a delivery goes out on its own — no second prompt from anyone — with its entry in
 * the thread, the Context view listing it, and no message of anyone added.
