 * what a Session has to survive. So a Session written by one file is opened again by the next,

 * A suite that opened the data folder of this machine would migrate it, back it up and write
 * to it — which is the one thing no test is allowed to do. The application accepts the folder
 * because it is a `dev` build; a package would ignore the argument.
 *
 * One folder per spec file, because a data folder is state and state shared between files is
 * one suite deciding what the next one starts on: a sidebar left folded by one is a header the
 * next cannot find its way around. Each spec file therefore gets a capability of its own, which
 * is the only place the service reads the folder from — but for the few that go on from another
 * one, which is what `CONTINUED` is and why it is written above.
 *
 * The path is spelled out rather than drawn from `mkdtemp`, because this file is evaluated once
 * by the launcher and once again inside every worker: a folder made on evaluation would be a
 * different folder in each of them, and a suite checking what a *second* start does would be
 * starting it somewhere else entirely.
