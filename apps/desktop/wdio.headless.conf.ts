/**
 * The end-to-end run with no window on screen (issue #67).
 *
 * The same suite as `wdio.conf.ts`, with `HEMERA_E2E_HEADLESS=1` set on the launcher: the
 * workers, the driver and the application it starts inherit it from there, so the window opens
 * off screen and nothing takes the focus of whoever is using the machine. Set here rather
 * than on the command line, because `VAR=1 command` is not something every shell understands.
 *
 * On Linux, outside CI, an off-screen position means nothing to a Wayland compositor, which
 * places windows itself: the run starts a headless weston before each worker and stops it
 * after, and the workers inherit its socket the way they inherit the variable
 * (`e2e/compositor.ts`). It also starts and ends on a temporary directory with nothing of a
 * suite left in it. Elsewhere the run is the one it always was.
 *
 *   pnpm --filter @hemera/desktop e2e:headless
