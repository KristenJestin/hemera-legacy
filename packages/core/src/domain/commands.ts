/**
 * The commands of a Project, and the one process each of them becomes (design D6-12).
 *
 * A command is a name the agent asks for and a line that runs: `app` for what stays up and
 * publishes an address, `check` for what verifies and ends with an exit code, `utility` for
 * everything else. The folder is optional and means the Workspace root when it is absent, or
 * one of the Project's repositories when it is there — never a path outside both.
 *
 * Two of the rules live here because they are rules and not plumbing: an `app` command that is
 * already running is returned rather than started again, and the address a reader sees is the
 * first one the output names. Everything else about a command — starting it, keeping its output,
 * stopping its tree — belongs to the engine, which owns the process.
