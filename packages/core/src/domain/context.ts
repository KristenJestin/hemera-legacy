 * the agent is given once, at the start of the Session, by whatever means its adapter has: the
 * system prompt on Claude Code, an embedded resource in the first prompt on Codex and OpenCode.
 * The instructions are the Workspace's `AGENTS.md`. An agent that reads it itself, even bare, is
 * not sent it: Hemera records its fingerprint and says it was read natively. One whose bare mode
 * keeps it from reading it (Claude Code, OpenCode) is given it at the start of the Session, as a
 * resource of the first prompt. Its adapter declares which.
 *
 * A change of `AGENTS.md` is not a prompt: it leaves between two turns as an identifiable
 * delivery — the new text as a resource, and a marker saying who sent it — so that a thread
 * shows a delivery and never a sentence attributed to the user.
