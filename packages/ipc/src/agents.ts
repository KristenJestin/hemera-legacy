 *
 * `found` is whether the agent's own command is on the machine at all, and `version` is what it
 * answered to `--version`: null when it is not there, or there and silent about its version.
 * Null and not absent, because nothing is optional over this wire — a field the page does not
 * receive and a field nothing answered look the same to it, and the page has to say which one it
 * is showing.
 *
 * `authenticated` is what the login file that agent writes says: the file is looked for and never
 * opened, and signed in or not is the one bit of it the page shows (D5-21). An agent whose
 * credentials no file answers for — the Keychain on macOS, a keyring — reads as signed out here,
 * and the word that counts is the one it gives to a Session that asks it to `initialize` (D5-17).
 * `installHint` is the one sentence that says how to get the agent, and `loginHint` the command
 * that signs it in, which the page offers when it is not signed in.
 *
 * `latest` is the version published for the agent — Homebrew's formula for a `brew` install, the
 * npm registry for any other, `unknown` included — and it is null whenever nobody asked or the
 * registry answered nothing: the list a Session is created from is read locally, and only the
 * Agents section goes to the network, when it is opened (D5-18). The installer decides whether
 * an update is offered, never whether the version is read.
 *
 * `bareMode` is what the adapter declares and not what the machine answered: it is read off
 * Hemera's own adapter for this platform, so it is there whether or not the agent is (D6-02).
