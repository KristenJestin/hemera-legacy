 * changed is `updated`. "The branch" is everything between the point it left the base and the
 * working tree, uncommitted and untracked files included, so a badge shows up as soon as the file
 * is saved. The base is `origin/dev`, the integration branch, unless `HEMERA_STORYBOOK_BASE`
 * names another. Where Git cannot answer — no remote, a shallow clone, no Git at all — no badge
 * is shown and nothing fails: a badge is a help to the reader, never a reason for the catalogue
 * not to start.
