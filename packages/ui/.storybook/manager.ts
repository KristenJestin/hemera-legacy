/**
 * The two badges of the sidebar, and the whole of what the catalogue shows beside an entry.
 *
 * A branch's stories are found by looking, not by reading a diff: the story file it created wears
 * `new`, the one whose file or component it changed wears `updated`. Git decides, when Storybook
 * indexes the stories (`badges.ts`), so what a badge says is always about what is being reviewed
 * and no story file writes one.
 *
 * The addon ships a wider default set (alpha, deprecated, version…): none of it is kept, because
 * a badge nobody asked for is a badge nobody reads. It also picks the first badge an entry
 * matches, so the order below is the priority.

/**
 * Storybook's own chrome follows the theme the toolbar is on (design D1-06).
 *
 * The toolbar swaps the theme of the story; the sidebar, the toolbar and the panels around it
 * are a separate application with a theme of its own, and a dark story framed in a white
 * manager is a contrast nobody can judge. The manager listens to the same global the preview
 * reads, so there is one switch and not two.
