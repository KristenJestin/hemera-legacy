/**
 * A command Hemera runs for a Session, as the thread reads it (design D6-12).
 *
 * A command is one process owned by Hemera, whoever started it: the agent through its tool, or
 * the reader through the Commands panel. Both watch the same process, so both read the same
 * line here — the command, where it runs, what it exited with, and the URL it published once
 * its output named one. That URL is the point of the block: a server started in a corner and
 * forgotten is what this lot exists to end, so the address is on the line, one press away.
 *
 * The line stays open while the process runs, for the same reason a console does: what the
 * reader is waiting on is the output. Once it exits 0 it folds itself, like the rest of the turn,
 * and its exit code is what is read instead; a check that failed stays open on its output.
 *
 * A one-off command line is marked as one: it runs inside the Workspace root, shows here, and
 * is never promoted to the catalogue by itself. The reader is the one who decides what a
 * Project keeps.
