/**
 * What folds: a line that is read while it is closed, and what is inside once it is asked for
 * (design D17-05).
 *
 * Three of the blocks of a turn are the same shape — a thought, a tool call, the console of a
 * command — and the shape is what keeps a turn readable rather than what decorates it. An agent
 * writes twenty lines of reasoning and four tool calls to answer one question; a thread that
 * showed all of it would be a thread nobody finishes, and one that showed none of it would be a
 * thread nobody trusts. So each block says what it is in one line and waits.
 *
 * The heading is the trigger and the whole row is it: an 8 px chevron is a hard target, and the
 * pointer that lands anywhere on the row is a pointer that opens it.
 *
 * **The body grows and folds, and the fold is the growth played backwards** — the `expand` and
 * `collapse` kinds of the preset, on `morph`, which is the spring made for a dimension. Until
 * the trial of 22 September 2026 it opened with a `clip-path` walking down a body already laid
 * out at full height, and closed by vanishing: D0-06 forbade animating a height, so there was
 * no opening to play backwards, and Base UI's `Collapsible` took the body out of the page the
 * moment the state changed — a panel only stays mounted for it while a *CSS* animation is
 * running, and a spring driven in JavaScript is not one. Two things had to go for the close to
 * read: the missing `exit`, and the thing that unmounted the body before any exit could play.
 * So the fold carries its own state — a button with `aria-expanded` and the body it names —
 * and `AnimatePresence` holds the body in the page for exactly as long as it takes to fold.
 *
 * The body is mounted when it opens and gone once it has closed, which is what makes both ends
 * of that possible: a console re-reads its bottom when it is opened again, which is where a
 * live console belongs.
 *
 * What the fold moves is not this component's business, and is not teleported either: whatever
 * holds a column of folds — the thread, in `message/scroller` — carries the blocks under it on
 * `layout`, so the page below travels instead of arriving already somewhere else (trial of
 * 22 September 2026).
