/**
 * A console the agent is running, as it writes (design D17-06).
 *
 * A command that takes a minute is a command the reader watches, and what they watch is the end
 * of its output. So the console is open while it runs, and it keeps its own bottom: every line
 * that arrives scrolls the box, which is the one place in the application where scroll is
 * driven by what arrives rather than by the hand. The box scrolls inside the thread and stops
 * there — a console that pulled the thread with it would move the page under a reader who is
 * reading further up.
 *
 * When the agent lets the console go it stays in the thread. That is the point of it: the job
 * leaves the agent, but what it printed is what explains the turn afterwards. What it loses is
 * the live mark and the open fold — a released console folds like the rest of the turn, and a
 * press brings its output back.
