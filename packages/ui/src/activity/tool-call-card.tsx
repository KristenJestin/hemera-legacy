/**
 * One tool call of a turn: what the agent asked for, and what came back (design D17-04).
 *
 * A turn is mostly tool calls — reads, edits, commands — and the thread has to say what the
 * agent did without becoming a log. So a call is one line while it runs, one line when it is
 * done, and the body only when somebody asks: the parameters of a read are noise after the read
 * succeeded, and they are the whole story when it failed.
 *
 * Every card starts folded, whatever its state (trial of 22 September 2026, evening). A card
 * that opened itself for a call in flight or a call that failed was a Session reopened on the
 * body of a command that had failed an hour ago, and a thread whose shape depended on how its
 * calls had ended. The state is the dot on the row; the body is the reader's to open. A caller
 * may still ask for a card to start open, and nothing in the application does.
 *
 * What the reader chose is held here rather than inside the fold, so that it survives the entry
 * being written again on every update of the turn, and the row losing and regaining its chevron
 * with it — and it is not asked again when the status moves on: a card the reader opened on a
 * running call is still open when the call is done.
 *
 * What the call is called is drawn in the reading colour of a caption and not of the thread: a
 * column of forty call titles in the colour of what the agent *said* is a column where the
 * answer and the plumbing weigh the same. A command keeps the mono face, because a command is
 * read character by character and not as words.
 *
 * Where it stands is a dot, and no longer a word. `Done` under `Done` under `Done` said nothing
 * the reader did not already know and stole the eye from the one line that had gone wrong; the
 * colour says the same five things in the width of a dot, and the word is kept for whatever
 * reads the page.
 *
 * A call with nothing behind it — no input, no output, no body of its own and no error — does
 * not fold at all: no chevron, no press, nothing to open. A control that opens onto nothing is
 * a control that lied about having something there.
 *
 * The file a call touched is a press at the end of the row rather than the title itself: the
 * title is the fold, a control cannot live inside a control, and a link inside a button is a
 * link the keyboard walks over and a screen reader never announces. The row still folds
 * anywhere the pointer lands on it.
