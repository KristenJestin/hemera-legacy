/**
 * One tool call of a turn: what the agent asked for, and what came back (design D17-04).
 *
 * A turn is mostly tool calls — reads, edits, commands — and the thread has to say what the
 * agent did without becoming a log. So a call is one line while it runs, one line when it is
 * done, and the body only when somebody asks: the parameters of a read are noise after the read
 * succeeded, and they are the whole story when it failed.
 *
 * Every card starts folded, whatever its state (trial of 22 September 2026, evening). A card
 * that opened itself for a call in flight or a call that failed was a Session reopened on the
 * body of a command that had failed an hour ago, and a thread whose shape depended on how its
 * calls had ended. The state is the dot on the row; the body is the reader's to open. A caller
 * may still ask for a card to start open, and nothing in the application does.
 *
 * What the reader chose is held here rather than inside the fold, so that it survives the entry
 * being written again on every update of the turn, and the row losing and regaining its chevron
 * with it — and it is not asked again when the status moves on: a card the reader opened on a
 * running call is still open when the call is done.
 *
 * What the call is called is drawn in the reading colour of a caption and not of the thread: a
 * column of forty call titles in the colour of what the agent *said* is a column where the
 * answer and the plumbing weigh the same. A command keeps the mono face, because a command is
 * read character by character and not as words.
 *
 * Where it stands is a dot, and no longer a word. `Done` under `Done` under `Done` said nothing
 * the reader did not already know and stole the eye from the one line that had gone wrong; the
 * colour says the same five things in the width of a dot, and the word is kept for whatever
 * reads the page.
 *
 * A call with nothing behind it — no input, no output, no body, no error and no name — does
 * not fold at all: no chevron, no press, nothing to open. A control that opens onto nothing is
 * a control that lied about having something there.
 *
 * The line reads the way a Hemera call's does (recette 3 of 23 September 2026): the mark of the
 * kind, what a reader calls it and what it is about, the whole line in the colour of a caption
 * (recette 5 of 24 September 2026). The kind is the label — `Read file`, `Run command` — and a
 * call of no kind is read by the title the agent gave it. What it is about is the subject: the
 * file, the query, the command line. The agent's own name for the tool, when the adapter gives
 * one, is the first line of the open body rather than the end of the line: it is for whoever
 * reads the thread against the agent's log, and a card with a name has something to open.
 *
 * When the subject is the file a call touched and the reader can go there, the subject itself is
 * the press, where it is read: a press at the end of the row was a second copy of the same path.
 * The row still folds anywhere else the pointer lands on it, and the press is on the fold's own
 * line, so the body opening under it does not carry it along (trial of 23 September 2026).
