/**
 * The gate: the turn is stopped, and it does not go on until someone answers (design D17-09).
 *
 * An agent that is allowed to edit files has to be told when it may. The answer is not a
 * dialogue — it is a decision, taken once, about one call — so the card says what the call would
 * do, the parameters that decide the answer, and the complete change when the call carries one.
 * A gate that hides what it is guarding is a gate people learn to open without reading.
 *
 * The buttons are the agent's options, all of them, in the order of the risk they carry: the
 * refusal first, the one-shot permission next, and the standing rule last, because a rule that
 * outlives the request is the one answer that deserves a second look. Nothing here invents an
 * answer the agent did not offer — a client that offers "allow always" to an agent that only
 * asked once is a client that widens a permission on its own.
 *
 * The card does not take the keyboard: it arrives while the reader is somewhere else, and
 * stealing the caret from a half-written sentence is how a prompt stops being finished. The
 * arrows walk the options from inside the card, Escape takes the refusal, and Enter is the
 * focused button's own press.
 *
 * The head reads the way the call's own line does (recette 3 of 23 September 2026): what a reader
 * calls the tool, what it is about, and what it asks — "Write file ../outside.txt asks to act
 * outside the Workspace" — rather than the tool's code name above a sentence that repeats it.
 * Without a label, the tool's name heads the card and the sentence stands under it, as before.
