/**
 * A box to tick, on Base UI (recette of 24 September 2026).
 *
 * Every box of the application is this one and never the platform's `<input type="checkbox">`:
 * the platform draws its own box in its own colours and sizes, which no token reaches, and each
 * page that took it wrote its own ring around it. Base UI owns what a checkbox has to do — the
 * role, the state a screen reader hears, Space to toggle, the hidden input a form reads — and
 * this draws it in the theme.
 *
 * The label is the whole target, as a native one is: the box and its words sit in one `<label>`,
 * so a press on the words ticks the box. `hiddenLabel` completes the name for a screen reader
 * where the same visible words sit on every row of a list.
 *
 * The tick is a stroke that draws itself as the box is checked, with a small give of the box,
 * and undraws as it is unchecked, while the fill fades under it (issue #185).
