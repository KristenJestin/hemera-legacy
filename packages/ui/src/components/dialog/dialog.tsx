/**
 * The dialog, on Base UI (design D1-04).
 *
 * The title and the description are parts rather than props of a box, so the dialog is named
 * and described to a screen reader by the same text the eye reads. Base UI traps the focus
 * while it is open and gives it back to whatever opened it on close; Escape and a click
 * outside both close it, because a dialog that can only be dismissed one way is a trap.
 *
 * It rises into place while the page behind it goes soft, and sinks back the same way. The
 * rise is a transform and the veil only fades: its blur is there from the first frame to the
 * last, and it is its opacity that comes and goes (issue #183). A blur that grew from nothing
 * was worked out again over the whole page on every frame of the fade, which dropped frames and
 * drew the page's own layers — the composer, a button of the Spec panel — outside the veil for
 * a frame before they sank under it: the page behind a dialog seemed to move when nothing in it
 * had.

 * The body of a dialog, as tall as what it holds and never jumping to it (issue #183).
 *
 * What a dialog holds changes while it is open: a choice brings fields in or takes them away, a
 * tab shows another panel. The body follows it on `morph`, the spring made for a dimension, so
 * the dialog grows or folds as one thing — everything under the change moves with it on the same
 * beat, instead of some of it gliding and the rest landing at once. What arrives is at its place
 * from the first frame and is uncovered by the growth; what it is taller than stays cut until
 * the spring has settled, and only then may the body scroll.
 *
 * The height is read off what it holds, whenever that changes size, and two readings are taken
 * at once rather than played. The first is where the body already is, so a dialog opening does
 * not grow into place on top of its own rise. And a reading that comes on the frame after the
 * last one is something inside the body moving on its own — a disclosure unfolding on its own
 * spring — which the body follows frame by frame: played again, the growth would trail behind
 * it and cut what it had already uncovered. A reader asking for less movement gets the new
 * height at once.
