/**
 * Hemera's face (issue #140): a small mascot whose expression, motion and colour say what an
 * agent is doing, in place of the robot icons wherever an agent's state is shown.
 *
 * Two eyes and a mouth, each one stroke of three points; every state a way of placing them, of
 * moving the head and of blinking. Inside a state the face lives on dice drawn from its seed, so
 * it never loops and the same seed tells the same story. Between two states it never cuts: every
 * change is a motion from wherever the face is — eyes, mouth, head and colour together.
 *
 * The stories are the gate the face is validated on before it replaces any icon: every state,
 * every change between two states, a change interrupted half-way, every size, reduced motion,
 * and a seeded life.
