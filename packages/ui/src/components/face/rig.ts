 * The head: how a pose is laid on the drawing, in a square of 32 units.
 *
 * A small model in three dimensions rather than a sliding picture. The eyes ride a circle seen
 * from above, so a turn slides them and squashes the far one against the near; eyes and mouth
 * ride a circle seen from the side, so a nod moves them by different amounts and a face tipping
 * down opens its eyes out while its mouth flattens. What sells a turn is not that things move, it
 * is that they move by different amounts — and a change of shape survives at sixteen pixels where
 * a change of position does not.
