/**
 * The tooltip, on Base UI (design D2-04).
 *
 * One delay for all of them, declared once by the provider the shell puts at its root: the
 * first tooltip of a row waits, and the ones the pointer walks onto next appear at once. That
 * is the behaviour a rail of icons needs — a sidebar folded to icons is unreadable if every
 * name costs the same wait — and it is the reason the delay is not a prop of each tooltip.
 *
 * It opens in CSS through Base UI's `data-starting-style` rather than through motion: the
 * element enters and leaves with the popup itself, and a spring driven from React would have
 * to be told when the popup is gone. Opacity and scale only, on the theme's curve.
