 * modes whose names are sentences; Codex with four models and no effort at all; OpenCode with
 * thirty models under three providers, which is where a list has to scroll and a search has to
 * earn its place; and one agent that is installed and signed out, which the panel has to draw
 * and refuse.
 *
 * Nothing here is a component of the design system: it is the story's own engine, and it lives
 * beside the story files instead of inside one of them so that they all show the same machine.

/**
 * The page the menu sits on, which is the one that knows what was chosen.

 * and modes are what the panel is handed next, and pick a model and the efforts that model
 * announces are — so a story is walked end to end rather than posed. A story that pins its own models wins over it, which is how `Loading`, `ManyModels`
 * and `Refusal` say what they are about.
 *
 * Changing the agent clears the model, the effort and the mode: a model id belongs to the agent
 * that announced it, and carrying one across would ask an agent for a model it never published.
 * Changing the model lands the effort on the level the new model advises while nobody has chosen
 * one, which is what Hemera asks the agent for (decision of 23 September 2026): the agent on its
 * own keeps whatever its settings say, and a thumb left there reads as the model's default. Once
 * a level is chosen it stays across the models, and a model that advises none leaves the effort
 * where it was. The rule across the scale is where the page puts it: at the level the efforts
 * on offer mark as advised, and nowhere when none of them is.
