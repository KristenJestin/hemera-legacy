/**
 * **What the next turn runs on, asked in one place**: which agent, then which of the models
 * *that* agent announced, then how hard it should think and what it may do without asking.
 *
 * It is two stages. The agents are the first; picking one takes the panel to the second, where
 * the models are searched on the left and the effort and the modes stand in a column of their
 * own on the right, under the line that names the agent and is the way back. The two stages sit
 * side by side on one rail twice the panel's width, and going on moves the rail one panel to
 * the left, so the models are read as pushing the agents out of the way rather than as
 * replacing them.
 *
 * **The box never moves a pixel** — one height and one width, on both stages, while the agent's
 * options are being read and once they have landed. It opens upwards out of the foot of the
 * composer, where a panel that grew would be flipped to the other side under the hand that
 * opened it. The agent stage has four rows and does not fill that box: it is drawn at the top
 * of it, and what is left under it is the panel's own surface.

 * `MotionConfig` is the way the preference is said here rather than the browser's own media
 * query, for the reason the thread's own fold gives: the query is read once, when a component
 * mounts, and a story that emulates it afterwards is testing a tree that never heard. What is
 * proved is the rule — a panel told to move less does not travel faster, it arrives.
