/**
 * The foot of the composer: which Workspace is being written about, and what sending does.
 *
 * Sending is the one live control of the row, and the only one that writes: `onSend` hands the
 * sentence to the page, which records it and answers with the reason it could not, or with
 * nothing when it did. `New Spec` is the Home's alone and stays disabled there — a Spec is made
 * from the question that starts a Session, and the Spec itself is lot 6 — and the arrow becomes a
 * square while the write is in flight: two icons crossing in opacity and scale, a morph a
 * compositor carries, and never a swap that flickers.
 *
 * The square is two states that share a glyph. A write in flight cannot be interrupted — that
 * is lot 5's, and the button is disabled while it is drawn. A turn running can be: the square is
 * then the Stop of design D17-13, it says so, and pressing it cancels the turn. One glyph, two
 * meanings, told apart by the word beside it and by whether it can be pressed at all.
 *
 * A write in flight changes nothing of the control: the same square, in the same place, and the
 * same word. It adds the indicator the button draws in front of its label, and takes the press
 * away until the engine has answered — the row does not move under the hand that pressed it.
