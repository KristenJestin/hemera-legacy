 * The composer: what a Session is started from, complete and inert in this lot (D4-07, D4-08).
 *
 * A `Frame`, and the one frame whose rim comes and goes. The box is the body — where the caret
 * is, the border and the ring — the Workspace and the actions stay open in the rim below it,
 * and the files attached appear open in the rim above it the moment there is one.
 *
 * Nothing inside animates a height. The frame carries `layout`, the header enters in opacity
 * and travel, and motion plays the difference between the two frames as a transform: the box
 * and the footer slide down as the header appears, which is the movement the prototype earned.
 *
 * The box itself grows with the text, from two lines to eight, and stops there. That is the
 * browser's own `field-sizing`, not an animation: a box that eased its way to a new height
 * would be a box lagging behind the sentence being typed into it.
