/**
 * The composer: what a Session is started from, and what is written into one (design D4b-02,
 * D4-08).
 *
 * A `Frame`, and the one frame whose rim comes and goes. The body is the prompt input — the
 * box, its shape and the keys that end a sentence — the Workspace and the actions stay open in
 * the rim below it, and the files attached appear open in the rim above it the moment there is
 * one.
 *
 * Nothing inside animates a height. The frame carries `layout`, the header enters in opacity
 * and travel, and motion plays the difference between the two frames as a transform: the box
 * and the footer slide down as the header appears, which is the movement the prototype earned.
 *
 * What is written and what is attached belong to the page, and so does the write: `onSend`
 * answers with the reason a message could not be recorded, or with nothing when it was. A
 * refusal leaves the sentence exactly where it was — a sentence that could not be written is
 * the one thing a hand must not have to type twice. A write that went through empties the box
 * and the files that went with it and puts the caret back, because a box that kept what it had
 * just sent would have to be cleared by every page that uses it, and one of them would forget.
