/**
 * **How hard the agent is to think, as the instrument the maintainer kept on 22 September
 * 2026.** One track sunk into a groove, one notch per level, a short mark beside each of them,
 * a lit thumb on the level that is on and the agent's own word for it over the top.
 *
 * Read down, a scale reads as a scale: more at the top, less at the bottom, and the distance
 * between two levels is the distance the thumb travels. It costs the height a row of steps did
 * not spend and buys back the width that row did — which is the trade the panel wanted, since
 * a panel has height to spare and no width at all.
 *
 * It is a slider and not a row of notches: the track is pressed, dragged and walked with the
 * keys. The thumb follows the hand while it is held and drops onto the nearest notch when it is
 * let go, a press anywhere on the track is the nearest notch, and the arrows, the page keys,
 * Home and End walk it without a pointer at all. It takes the focus once and says where it
 * stands in the agent's own word through `aria-valuetext`.
 *
 * The level the model puts a Session on by itself — its own default, handed over as
 * `defaultId` — is a thin accent rule laid across the track at its notch, never a value of its
 * own, and it is where the scale opens. What the agent *advises* draws nothing: Claude advises
 * `Medium` for every model, which says nothing about any of them. An agent that announced a `Default` nobody
 * could resolve gets no notch for it at all: the real levels are the scale, and the thumb waits
 * at the foot of it with `Default` written above until a level is chosen.
