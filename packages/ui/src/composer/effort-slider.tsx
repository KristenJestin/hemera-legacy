/**
 * The effort, as the instrument the maintainer kept on 22 September 2026.
 *
 * A thin track sunk into a groove, one notch per level the agent announced, the part of it
 * under the thumb filled in the accent, a lit twenty-pixel thumb on the level that is on, the
 * agent's own word for that level over the top of it, and down the left of the track a short
 * mark per notch — `L M H XH Max` — so five dots are five levels rather than five dots.
 *
 * **Why down and not across.** A scale of six levels read across a narrow panel gives each of
 * them four characters and reads as six buttons; read down, it reads as what it is — more of
 * something at the top, less of it at the bottom — and the panel has height to spare where it
 * has no width at all. The highest effort is at the top, which is the one thing a vertical
 * scale is not allowed to get wrong: the fill grows up from the foot of the track.
 *
 * **It is dragged, and not only pressed.** The scale takes the pointer on the way down —
 * `setPointerCapture`, so a hand that leaves the track sideways goes on moving the thumb — the
 * thumb follows that hand rather than jumping between notches, and the level under it is set as
 * it is passed. Letting go drops the thumb onto the nearest notch. A press anywhere on the
 * track, notch or no notch, is that same movement with no movement in it: the nearest notch.
 * Touch is the same events and so the same control, and the track claims the gesture
 * (`touch-none`) rather than letting the column it sits in scroll under the finger.
 *
 * The wheel is deliberately *not* read. This control stands in a column that scrolls, and a
 * wheel that set a level instead of scrolling that column would take a gesture the reader
 * aimed past it — a level is not worth a scroll nobody gets back.
 *
 * **One control, not a list of them.** It is a `slider`: it takes the focus once, says where it
 * stands in the agent's own word through `aria-valuetext` — "High", not "4 of 6" — and the keys
 * walk it, the arrows by one, the page keys by a third of the scale, Home and End at the two
 * ends. The notches are marks and answer the pointer through the scale itself, because a notch
 * that took the focus would be a second control inside a control that already has a role.
 *
 * **The model's own default is a rule across the track**, at that level's notch, and never a
 * notch of its own (decision of 22 September 2026). It is the level the model puts a Session on
 * by itself — `Xhigh` for Opus, `High` for Fable — handed over as `defaultId`, and it moves when
 * the model does; what the agent *advises* (`recommended`) is one generic level for every model
 * and draws nothing here (probe of 22 September 2026). A thin accent line laid across the scale
 * is read the way the red line on a dial is read — this is where it sits by itself — without
 * offering a value of its own; the word `default` is said beside the level's own name while
 * that level is the one standing, and in `aria-valuetext` for whoever cannot see the line. It
 * is also where the scale opens: handed nothing at all, it rests on the model's default,
 * because that is what the next turn would run at.
 *
 * **`Default` is not a notch.** An agent that never said which level its `Default` stands for
 * leaves it announced as a value like any other, and a scale cannot place a level whose meaning
 * nobody knows: the notches are the real levels alone, and where `Default` is what is set the
 * thumb sits at the foot of the track with the word above it reading `Default`, until a level
 * is chosen. Nothing is guessed here — resolving that value is the engine's business, and it
 * does it the moment the agent gives it the means.
 *
 * **Nothing moves when the level does.** Every word of the scale is drawn in the same cell of a
 * grid and all but the one that is on are `invisible`: the column is as wide as the longest
 * word the agent announced, whichever word is being shown. Nothing is measured and nothing is
 * laid out twice. The description under it, where the agent gives one, is the same stack — so a
 * level explained in eight words does not push the panel taller than one explained in three —
 * and the marks stand in a column one width wide, so the track never shifts sideways either.
 *
 * **What moves** is the thumb and the fill, on `morph` where they are travelling on their own
 * and not at all while a hand is holding them: the hand draws them itself, in the pointer event,
 * because a spring under the finger is a thumb lagging behind the hand dragging it — and so is
 * a thumb waiting for a render and for motion's next frame, which on a slow machine is a thumb
 * still where the press landed when the hand is already elsewhere (CI of 22 September 2026).
 * `morph` is the spring that arrives without turning round — a
 * thumb that overshot its notch and came back would read as a value set and then changed — and
 * `useTransition` answers a reader asking for less movement with the notch and no glide at all.
 * Under the hand and under the focus the halo brightens and the thumb grows, which is CSS and
 * stops on its own where less movement was asked for.
