/**
 * The files of the Project, offered while `@` is being typed (design D4-07, D4-09).
 *
 * A band of the composer's own frame and no longer a popup. It used to be a popover anchored to
 * the `@` control, opening upwards: it covered the thread — the last thing written, which is
 * what the reader is answering — and it floated over a box it belongs to. It is now drawn inside
 * the frame, directly under the text that is being typed and above the row of tools, which it
 * pushes down: the frame grows while the list is open and shrinks back when it closes, and the
 * list is part of the thing it is helping to write rather than a sheet over the page.
 *
 * It takes no focus, and cannot: it is a list beside a caret that never left the box. The arrows
 * and Enter are read by the box, which is why the list here only says which entry they would
 * land on.
 *
 * Paths are drawn in the mono face. The files are handed over already filtered and already
 * bounded — reading a folder is the main process's to do, and how far it reads is its rule,
 * not this component's.
 *
 * A path too long for the row is cut and nothing is offered to read the rest: the native
 * `title` that used to be here arrived a second late, in the desktop's own black box, in a
 * shape that belongs to no theme of ours. What the eye needs is already at the front of the
 * path, and what the hand needs is one more character typed.

/**
 * The band: the frame's own width, a line above it, and a bounded height of its own.
 *
 * Bounded, because the composer may not become the page: a folder of forty matches would
 * otherwise push the tool row and the foot off the bottom of a short window.
