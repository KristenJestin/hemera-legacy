/**
 * The icon catalogue: the only door Tabler comes through (design D1-05).
 *
 * Tabler ships five thousand icons at whatever size and stroke the caller asks for. What
 * Hemera wants is a short list drawn the same way everywhere, so each entry is re-exported
 * already sized on a step of the icon scale and already at the application's weight. The
 * boundary check refuses `@tabler/icons-react` anywhere but here, which is what keeps the
 * list short and keeps a hand-written SVG out of the repository.
 *
 * Outlined, at Tabler's own stroke rather than below it. A thinner stroke is what made these
 * look muddy at the sizes an interface actually uses, and a heavier one is the cure; going
 * solid is not. "Filled" is not a uniform mode in Tabler — for an icon whose meaning lives in
 * its outline the filled variant drops the part that carries it, and the sun loses its rays
 * and becomes a dot. `weight="filled"` is kept for the few where a solid shape reads better:
 * a warning, a trash can, a gear.
