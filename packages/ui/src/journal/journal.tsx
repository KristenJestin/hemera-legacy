/**

 *
 * It holds nothing and computes nothing. The entries arrive in the order they are shown, each
 * carrying the day and the time already written for the platform the page is running on — a
 * design system that formatted a date would be a design system with a locale of its own. The
 * days are grouped here because grouping a list that is already in order is a walk, not a
 * decision.
 *
 * The filters say what is wanted; what answers them is the engine, one page at a time. The
 * component says which are on and calls back, so a filter never quietly hides an entry that was
 * read into the page: the page is asked again instead.
