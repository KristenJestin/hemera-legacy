 * the right, and Hemera's own notes are lines without a surface. Nothing here answers: the
 * thread is what the user wrote, and the last thing written is the last thing shown.
 *
 * The agent of `Conversation` and of `ARealThread` is a fixture and not a reply — nothing in
 * this catalogue answers — but the author itself is drawn, and `AgentAnswer` is what it looks
 * like: an agent writes Markdown and writes it while thinking, so its lines are drawn from the
 * text as it arrives (`AgentText`) while what the user wrote is drawn as it was typed. A thread
 * that drew the two the same way would show the syntax of an answer instead of the answer.
