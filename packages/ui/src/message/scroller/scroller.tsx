/**
 * The scroller of a Session: the thread, the rail that says where in it the reader is, and the
 * pill that takes them back to the live edge (design D4b-09).
 *
 * A thread is read from the bottom: what was written last is what matters, and a Session opens
 * on it. So the scroller is the one thing in the page that scrolls, and everything around it —
 * the title, the composer — stays where it is.
 *
 * The rail is the other half of the same answer. Forty messages are a column with no landmarks,
 * and a scrollbar says only how much of it is out of sight. The rail says how many marks there
 * are, which one the reader is on, and what each one begins with. It is drawn only when the
 * thread does not fit: a rail over a thread that is entirely on screen is a map of nowhere.
 *
 * Nothing here measures text, nothing animates a layout property or a colour, and no spring is
 * written outside the presets — what answers the hand is on `press`, what arrives is on
 * `arrival`, and `useTransition` is what turns either into the end state for a reader who asked
 * for less movement.
