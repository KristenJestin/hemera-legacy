/**
 * The motion personality of Hemera: a closed set of presets, and nowhere else to write a
 * spring. A lint check refuses a `stiffness`, a `damping` or a duration written anywhere but
 * this file, because a design system whose springs are scattered has no personality at all.
 *
 * Two of them, and not one, because one cannot do both jobs. The spring the prototype earned
 * is made for a panel that arrives without overshooting, and it takes its time doing it; under
 * a finger it takes so long to settle that a three per cent press is not visible at all. What
 * answers the hand has to be stiff and light, and what arrives on its own has to be soft.
 *
 * A third preset needs an interaction neither of these serves. The set is meant to stay short.

 * like nothing happened at all. What has to match between them is the movement, not the

 * property at once, so the journey is given no time instead. The tree still runs under
 * `MotionConfig reducedMotion="user"`: it is the net under any motion element that forgets
 * this hook, and the lint refuses one that does.
 *
 * Both ways of asking are honoured: the system preference, and a `MotionConfig` that says
 * `always`. `never` is not one of them, because `never` is also motion's own default: a
 * component rendered outside any `MotionConfig` reads it, and reading it as "this tree opted
 * out" is how the one guard the design system has ends up switched off by nobody.
