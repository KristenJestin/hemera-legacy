 * title of the page rather than under the last field: what it saves is the two cards above it,
 * and a button inside one of them would be claiming only that one. A page that saved each field
 * as it was typed would be a page writing a version of the Project per keystroke, and the engine
 * refuses a stale version rather than merging one.
 *
 * The repositories are their own thing — each line is added or taken away on its own — and the
 * archive sits at the bottom, alone, because it is the one action here that takes the Project
