/**
 * A Session with an agent in it, at once (design D17-11, D17-13).
 *
 * Every other story here shows one surface at a time; this one is the surface the reader
 * actually has, and it is the one the lot is judged on: the head, a thread carrying each kind of
 * block an agent reports, the column that holds what is a state rather than an event, and the
 * box the next turn is written in, with what the Session runs on at the end of its own row. A
 * block that reads well alone and badly here is a block that reads badly.
 *
 * The thread is drawn the way the renderer draws it — the user's runs grouped, the agent's
 * entries standing between them — so what this story proves about the page is what the page
 * does. Nothing here reaches an engine: the fixtures are what an agent would have reported.
