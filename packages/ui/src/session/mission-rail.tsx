/**
 * The rail of a mission panel: what the mission is made of, one quiet row each, grouped under
 * headers, and at its foot whatever the mission says of the whole (lot 19; the Spec's rail is
 * the first to use it, a `build` rail of tasks and workers the next).
 *
 * The rail knows nothing of a Spec. It is handed groups of items, each with its glyph, its name,
 * a count, and the one thing that needs attention about it, if anything does; and it draws them
 * the way the maintainer decided for the Spec (lot 19, the rail's states): a row says only what
 * needs attention, and says it with the row itself. An item with nothing to say carries nothing.
 * An empty one has its name in a fainter text. The one the agent is working on is tinted in the
 * primary, the tint breathing; one to review is tinted in the warning colour, one in conflict in
 * the destructive one. One edited by the reader wears nothing: the part itself says who wrote it,
 * and the only line on a row's left is the rule of what is on the stage. Each says its state in a
 * sentence, in its tooltip and as its accessible description.
 *
 * What is on the stage says so with a thin rule of the one accent and nothing else. A group opens
 * on its header, which reads as the header of a section and not as one more row: its name in the
 * small type of a label, a hairline above every group but the first, the rows set in under it. It
 * wears no state of its own but the warning tint when the group as a whole is to review. Pressed,
 * it puts the whole group on the stage, and the rule runs on the header and on every row under
 * it. `Show all` shows at its end under the hand and the keyboard, and only then.
 *
 * One stop of the tab order, and the arrows walk it: up and down, Home and End, Enter opens.
 *
 * Folded, the rail is the band the panel folds to beside the chat, and it keeps the hierarchy:
 * each group a block, its glyph in a tinted square, the smaller glyphs of its items right under
 * it and set in, and a gap and a hairline before the next group. The tints of the rows land on
 * the squares of the items; the names leave the eye and stay the accessible name and the
 * tooltip, beside the state.
