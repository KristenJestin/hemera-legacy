/**
 * The plan the agent is working to (design D17-16).
 *
 * A plan arrives whole, every time: the protocol sends the entries the agent is holding, and the
 * client replaces what it had rather than merging into it. Merging would be the one thing that
 * cannot be done here — an entry that a later notification took away would stay drawn, and the
 * reader would be reading a plan the agent no longer has.
 *
 * It is folded by default, with the count that says how far along it is: a plan is a thing the
 * reader checks on, not a thing that follows the thread down the page.
