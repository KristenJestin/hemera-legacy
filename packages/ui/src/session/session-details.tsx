/**
 * What the session has been doing, one press away (design D17-17, D6-10 and D6-12).
 *
 * Three questions a reader has while an agent works, and none of them belongs in the thread: the
 * plan it is working to and the files it has touched, the commands it runs, and what it is
 * working from. All three are states rather than events — the thread already carries every call
 * that touched them — so they are read here, on purpose, and growing them does not push the
 * conversation down the page.
 *
 * A centred dialog and not a column beside the thread (second review of #18): a column took a third
 * of the window from the thread whenever one of its tabs had something, and came and went with
 * what the agent did. The dialog opens when the reader asks for it, from the Session's head, and
 * nothing the agent does opens it by itself: a plan, a run or a permission that arrives updates
 * the thread and, while the dialog is open, the tab it concerns. It is as wide as the thread, its
 * content scrolls inside it, and Escape, its close button and a click outside all close it.
 *
 * Three tabs and not three stacked panels, because a reader who comes back to a Session where a
 * command is running wants that tab, not a scroll; the tab it opens on is the page's to say.
 * The dialog is the same height on all three (third review of #18): one that took the height of
 * each tab changed size under the hand switching them. What changes is the panel, crossfaded in
 * place, and a panel taller than the dialog scrolls inside it.
 *
 * Nothing here is a second inbox: what is listed is what the turn has done, and a file is listed
 * because a call named it.
