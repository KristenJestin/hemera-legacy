 *
 * The renderer's own page is an adapter: it holds the Session, the entries and the write, and
 * draws nothing of its own. This story is that page with the fixtures standing in for the
 * engine — which is what the UI gate is for: the surface is validated here, on the two themes
 * and at the keyboard, before anything is wired to a database.
 *
 * The thread is the user's alone. No agent answers, nothing is simulated, and the empty state
 * says so rather than showing an invented first line: a thread with a fake reply in it is the
 * one thing the spec forbids this lot to draw.
