/**
 * The agents this machine has, and the one thing the reader can do about them (design D17-01,
 * D5-18, D5-21).
 *
 * Hemera runs the agents that are installed here and nothing else. There is no fallback: an
 * agent that is missing is missing, and a session that opened on another one would be a session
 * the reader did not ask for. So the section says whether the agent is signed in, what was found
 * version and all, what was not found and what to do about it, and which one is installed but
 * not signed in — answers that are not the same answer, and only the last one is the reader's to
 * fix in one command.
 *
 * It names the agent and never the adapter a Session may reach it through: Claude Code, Codex
 * and OpenCode are what the reader installs, what the reader signs in, and the only names that
 * appear here (D5-21). The sign-in is read first and the command second, because two of the
 * three are reached through an adapter that carries its own copy of the agent — on such a
 * machine the login is what the agent needs to be usable, and the command is only where the
 * reader's own CLI is or is not.
 *
 * It is the shape of the other sections and not a shape of its own: the same card, the same rows
 * of key and value, the same quiet buttons under them. A reader who has read the Profile block
 * has read this one.
 *
 * Nothing here chooses and nothing here fetches. The choice of the agent belongs to the session
 * that is about to start, where the reader is the one who makes it; what the registries published
 * is asked once, when the section is opened, and never by this component. And an update runs on a
 * button press and on nothing else: Hemera does not move a tool on the reader's behalf.
