/**
 * The one bar of chrome, which is also the title bar (design D2-02).
 *
 * It sits in the strip the platform gives a frameless window and stops where the system draws
 * its own window buttons, because that is what `env(titlebar-area-*)` says and the bar reads it
 * at every render: nothing of ours is ever laid under the close button, whichever side the
 * desktop puts it on. The whole strip moves the window and each control opts back out, so the
 * bar is a title bar everywhere the eye sees nothing to press.
 *
 * Two segments in one grid. The first column is the sidebar's current width, written by the
 * shell as the sidebar folds, and it carries the name of the application and nothing else: the
 * mark stays exactly where it is at either width — dead centre of the rail once folded — and
 * the word beside it leaves with the labels of the sidebar. Everything that is pressed lives in
 * the second segment, the button that folds the sidebar first, then a rule, then the Projects,
 * so that the first column can be as narrow as a rail without dragging a control into it.
 *
 * The mark of the active Project is one element that slides between the tabs on `arrival`,
 * which is the movement the prototype earned. It lives inside the scrolling strip with the
 * tabs, never outside it, or it would be left behind by its own tab.
