/**
 * The separator between the sidebar and the content (design D2-03).
 *
 * It is a `separator` with a value, which is what a screen reader needs in order to say how
 * wide the panel is and what it may become; that is also what makes it focusable, because a
 * separator with a value is something the user can change. The arrows move it by a line of
 * text, Home and End take it to its bounds, and Enter folds the panel — the same three things
 * the hand can do, without the hand.
 *
 * The pointer's own position is the width, because the sidebar starts at the window's left
 * edge: there is nothing to measure, which is just as well, since measuring is what the width
 * check refuses. Dragging under the fold threshold folds the panel instead of leaving it
 * uselessly narrow, and the separator stays where it is once folded, so the same drag brings
 * it back.
 *
 * The drag is followed on the window rather than on the separator itself: a pointer that
 * leaves a one-pixel-wide element is a pointer that has left it, and a drag that stops the
 * moment the hand moves faster than the panel is a drag nobody can finish.
