 * The mark of Hemera — a placeholder, and said so out loud.
 *
 * Hemera is the day: a disc rising over a line. It is drawn here rather than taken from the
 * icon catalogue because it is not an icon — it is the name of the application, and it is the
 * one thing the chrome bar keeps when the sidebar folds down to its rail.
 *
 * It is drawn in `currentColor` and sized by the icon scale, like everything else in the bar,
 * so replacing it later is replacing this file and nothing around it.
