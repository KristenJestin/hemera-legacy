/**
 * The shell every screen of Hemera is drawn inside (design D2-01).
 *
 * It holds no data. Everything it shows is handed to it as props, which is what lets Storybook
 * render the whole window without Electron and what will let lot 4 put real Projects and
 * Sessions in it without touching a line of this file.
 *
 * Two rows: the chrome bar in the strip the platform reserves for a title bar, and everything
 * else underneath. The body is placed rather than padded, so the only element that can scroll
 * is the content area and nothing above it can ever be pushed out of view.
 *
 * One number crosses the whole layout: how wide the sidebar is right now. The sidebar animates
 * it and says so on every frame; the shell writes it down as `--sidebar-current-width` on the
 * chrome bar, whose first column is that variable. Writing a property on an element is not how
 * this repository styles anything — but this is the one value that changes sixty times a second,
 * and a class cannot carry it. One value, one writer, and two columns that cannot come apart.
 *
 * It is written on the bar and not here, and the difference is measurable: a custom property
 * written on an ancestor makes the browser recompute the style of everything beneath it, and
 * beneath the shell is the entire window. On the bar, the fold stops dropping frames.
