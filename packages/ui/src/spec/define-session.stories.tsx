/**
 * A `define` Session: the chat on the left, the Spec panel beside it (lot 19, the screens of the
 * brief, revision 2).
 *
 * The chat is the thread and the composer of the Session page, as they are; what `define` adds
 * to it is the thin Hemera line that says what the agent was handed this turn, and the questions
 * of the Spec, asked there and answered there. The panel takes the side column's place — there
 * is no side column while it is there. It opens folded to a band of glyphs, so the chat has the
 * width (brief revision 4): a screen that shows the panel's state opens it unfolded, and a path
 * unfolds it first, the way a hand does.
 * A `define` Session never exists without its Spec: it starts from a Spec, or from a `free`
 * Session whose agent proposes one. Every screen is the same Spec, `ATL-7`, taken through its
 * states, consistent with the product rules: no task before `decompose`, a full gate only once
 * every phase is finished.
