/**
 * A text of the Spec, edited where it is read (lot 19, the brief).
 *
 * It is a plain text area that looks like the rendered text until it has the focus: no Edit
 * button to find, no Save button to forget. The reader points at a sentence, the caret is in it;
 * the caret leaves, the text is handed over once — never a version per keystroke, which is what
 * the engine would refuse as stale anyway (D7-12). Escape puts back what was there and leaves.
 *
 * What it was handed is followed while nobody types in it: an agent that rewrites a section the
 * reader is only looking at is seen rewriting it. While the caret is inside, what is typed wins
 * on the screen, and the conflict rule is the section's to apply when the text is handed over.
 * What is handed over is measured against the text the edit started from, not the one that
 * stands when the caret leaves: a caret that leaves without typing hands nothing back, even when
 * the text was rewritten under it.
 */

/**
 * The area at rest reads as text: no border, no fill, the text's own size and leading. The hand
 * over it finds a surface; the caret in it finds the field, recessed onto the body surface with
 * the halo of the focus. The box follows the text (`field-sizing`), so nothing scrolls inside a
 * section and nothing is measured from JavaScript.
