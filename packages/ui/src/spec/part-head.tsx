/**
 * The top of a part of the Spec document: its name, and one quiet line of facts beside it. The
 * heading is the title alone: the rail already says the part's state, and the facts say who wrote
 * it, so no dot stands in the margin; the state is said in words to a screen reader alone
 * (revision 2 of the brief, "No outline: the Spec is a document").
 *
 * The facts say who wrote it and at which version — `agent · v3`, `you · v4 · sent to the agent
 * next turn` — and whatever the part offers on its own sits at the end of them, as small as they
 * are: a preview toggle, nothing bigger. `saved` flashes among them for a second after a save,
 * and is the whole of the confirmation: a save asked for by leaving the field does not need a
 * toast to say it happened.
