/**
 * Hemera's face (issue #140), asked what the issue asks of it: one expression per state an agent
 * can be in, a life inside each state that never loops and always tells the same story for the
 * same seed, a change between any two states that is a motion and never a cut — taken from
 * wherever the face is when it arrives half-way through another — sizes that simplify rather
 * than blur, and still expressions for a reader asking for less movement.
 *
 * The face is a function of time, so every one of these is asked one frame at a time, far faster
 * than a screen draws them, and nothing here waits for a clock.
